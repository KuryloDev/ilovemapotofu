**ilovemapotofu** is a Angel Beats! themed fan page. As of right now it serves no purpose other than to advertise our Angel Beats! Discord server and help people link to official sources. However, I am looking to revamp the page in the near future. Collaborations are highly appreciated!

## Summary 

This project is currently built with basic HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript attributes. Additionally there is a Bootstrap, Popper.js and jQuery integration. It is overall very bare bone. My plan is to rebuild the page from scratch with the usage of [Astro.js](https://astro.build/).

As for content, there is not much to it . I am thinking about adding small mini-games or an art gallery. I am very open to suggestions.
